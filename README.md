This time in ruby!

## Example usage
To solve **day 1, part 1**, run the following command:

```bash
rake solve:1:1
```

This downloads the input if it is not present, and it requires your AOC session cookie in the `.session` file.

To run **day 1, part 1** on `inputs/test.txt`, you would run:

```bash
rake test:1:1
```
